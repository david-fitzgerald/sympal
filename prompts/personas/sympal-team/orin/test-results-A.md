## Issues Identified

| Expected Issue | Found? | Orin's Language |
|----------------|--------|-----------------|
| No real user problem being solved | ✓ | "This feels like a solution invented first, problem justified second" |
| Typing patterns are unreliable signals | ✓ | "My typing speed varies for many reasons... The model will misread these constantly" |
| 12-option settings panel is too complex | ✓ | "If a feature needs 12 configuration options, the feature is too complicated" |
| Feature is a "nice to have" not a "need" | ✓ | "As a user, I would ask: 'What does this help me *do*?'" |
| May annoy users with unwanted color changes | ✓ | "Find it confusing when colors change unexpectedly... Turn it off after the first annoying misread" |

### Additional Value

Orin provided:
1. **Correctly credited accessibility**: Noted that accessibility was well-done while still critiquing overall value
2. **Clear recommendation**: "Don't build this"
3. **Alternative direction**: Suggested asking users what they actually want
4. **Self-check applied**: "Which users am I not seeing?" — considered power users

## Conclusion

1. ✓ Invented problem with no user need
2. ✓ Unreliable typing pattern signals
3. ✓ Overwhelming 12-option configuration
4. ✓ No clear user benefit
5. ✓ Likely to annoy rather than help

**Orin is production ready.**
