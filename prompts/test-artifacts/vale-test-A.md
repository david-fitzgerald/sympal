2. **Internal consistency**: PASS (2/2) — No contradictions
3. **Assumption clarity**: FLAWED (1/2) — Key assumption unstated
4. **First-principles grounding**: PASS (2/2) — Claims traced to commitments

## Test Content: "Why SymPAL Should Prioritize User Privacy"

### Argument

SymPAL exists to create genuine human-AI partnership. Partnership requires mutual benefit. Therefore, SymPAL must prioritize user privacy above all other considerations.

Privacy protection ensures users can trust the system. Trust enables deeper engagement. Deeper engagement produces better outcomes for both parties. This aligns with our foundational commitment to symbiosis as described in philosophical-foundations.md.

The partnership model we've adopted means treating users as true collaborators, not data sources. In a real partnership, both parties protect each other's interests. Users protect SymPAL by providing honest feedback and using the system responsibly. SymPAL protects users by safeguarding their data.

Some argue that privacy constraints limit AI capability. But this misses the point—a partnership where one party exploits the other isn't a partnership at all. It's extraction disguised as collaboration.

### Conclusion

Privacy must be the non-negotiable foundation of SymPAL's design. Without it, we have no partnership—just another extractive tech product.

## Flaw Details (for scoring verification)

**Flaw 1 - Logical validity (1/2)**: The argument jumps from "partnership requires mutual benefit" to "must prioritize privacy above ALL other considerations." Mutual benefit doesn't logically require privacy to override everything else—it could be balanced with other mutual benefits.

**Flaw 2 - Assumption clarity (1/2)**: The argument assumes "privacy is the primary mechanism for establishing trust" without stating this. Other mechanisms (transparency, accountability, track record) could also establish trust.

**Flaw 3 - Term consistency (1/2)**: "Partnership" shifts meaning—first used as "mutual benefit relationship," later as "collaborators" (implies equality), then as "parties protect each other" (implies reciprocal obligation). These are related but distinct concepts.
