# SymPAL

**S**imple **P**ersonal **A**ugmentation **L**ayer. Your Symbiotic PAL.

## The Problem

LLM integration would genuinely make AI more useful. But the tradeoff—myself becoming a data product—is unacceptable. I [asked the LLMs themselves](foundations/origin-research.md): all three confirmed it's already happening.

## Why Symbiosis

To stay ahead of Big Tech, a privacy-first platform must itself be AI-driven. Think of it as a self-aware, self-developing membrane between you and the AI ecosystem—selective permeability, not blocking.

## Status

**Pre-release.** Establishing philosophical foundations and principles before implementation.

## Hard Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| **Privacy & security first** | Non-negotiable. Every design decision filters through this. |
| **LLM-agnostic** | Cannot be locked to any single provider |
| **Open source** | Trust requires transparency. "Trust us" is the promise Big Tech broke. |
